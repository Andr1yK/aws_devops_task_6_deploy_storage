# AWS Essentials: Deploy Storage

Now, when you are familiar with S3 service, let's deploy one for backups of your Grafana deployment!

## Prerequirements

Before completing any task in the module, make sure that you followed all the steps described in the *Environment Setup* topic, in particular:

1. Make sure you have an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) account.
2. Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
3. Install [PowerShell Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4).
4. Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).
5. Log in to AWS CLI on your computer by running the command:

    ```
    aws configure
    ```

## Task Requirements

In this task, you will deploy an S3 bucket and configure access to it from your Grafana VM you deployed in the [previous task](https://github.com/mate-academy/aws_devops_task_5_use_iam_roles). With such infrastructure in place, you potentially can write a script, which uploads backups of your Grafana deployment to the S3 bucket (but such a script is not included in the task scope).

To complete this task:

1. Edit `terraform.tfvars` — fill out the `tfvars` file with the previous modules' outputs and your configuration variables. You should use those variables as parameters for the resources in this task. This task requires only one variable — `grafana_iam_role_arn`. You can get it as a Terraform module output in the [previous task](https://github.com/mate-academy/aws_devops_task_5_use_iam_roles).

2. Edit `main.tf` — add resources required for this task:

    - Use [`aws_s3_bucket`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket) resource to create an S3 bucket.
    - Use [`aws_s3_bucket_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_policy) and `aws_iam_policy_document` resources to authorize your Grafana VM to use the S3 bucket using a bucket policy. For that, `aws_iam_policy_document` resource should have two statements:
        - Both statements should use the Grafana IAM role ARN as an identifier (principal type — AWS).
        - The first statement should allow action `s3:ListBucket` only for the S3 bucket you deployed.
        - The second statement should allow `s3:GetObject` and `s3:PutObject` for all objects within the bucket you deployed.

3. After adding the code to the `main.tf`, review the `outputs.tf` file and make sure that all output variables are valid and can output relevant values, as described in the output variable descriptions.

4. Run the following commands to generate a Terraform execution plan in **JSON** format:

    ```
    terraform init
    terraform plan -out=tfplan
    terraform show -json tfplan > tfplan.json
    ```

5. Run an automated test to check yourself:

    ```
    pwsh ./tests/test-tf-plan.ps1
    ```

    If any test fails, please check your task code and repeat step 4 to generate a new `tfplan.json` file.

6. Deploy infrastructure using the following command:

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

    Make sure to collect module output.

7. Connect to your Grafana EC2 instance from the previous task, and run the following script, replacing `<bucket>` with the name of your S3 bucket:

    ```
    wget https://github.com/mate-academy/aws_devops_task_6_deploy_storage/raw/refs/heads/main/files/title.mp4 -O title.mp4
    aws s3 cp title.mp4 s3://<bucket>/
    ```

    Validate that the file was uploaded to the S3 bucket from your VM, and make a screenshot of command execution.

8. Commit `tfplan.json` file and the screenshot from the VM, and submit your solution for review.
9. Go and watch that video you uploaded to your S3 bucket — this is the last task in the module! Well done!
